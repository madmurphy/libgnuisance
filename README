About
-----

**GNUIsance** is a **GTK4** library that aims to create a consistent repository
of widgets and utilities that users might need only from time to time. By
design, these can be accessed altogether (`-lgnuisance`), or it is possible to
link only the single widgets required for an application (`-lgnuitaggedentry`,
`-lgnuiflow`, etc.).

Creating a library of interfaces for **GTK4** might sound pointless after
projects like **libadwaita**. Yet, an informal repository with an easy
threshold for contributing, one that modularly fills the small gaps of **GTK**
and **libadwaita**, might be missing after all.

At the moment **libgnuisance** is a only a tiny repository with few abstract
utilities, three widgets and a reusable layout manager:

* `GnuiEmblemPicker` – an emblem picker
* `GnuiFlow` – a flow container
* `GnuiFlowLayout` – a reusable layout manager that transforms any widget that
  adopts it into a flow container
* `GnuiTaggedEntry` – a tagged entry

If you want to experiment with them, under `sandbox/before-install` you can
play with the interfaces without having to install the library (the package's
icons will not be loaded).

Despite its modularity, the project aims at remaining consistent in all its
parts. The collection of widgets might grow in the future, or it might not. In
the meanwhile, please do have fun with it.

For more information, please visit [the library's documentation][1].


Get involved
------------

This project is truly open to contributions. If you like working with CSS,
**libgnuisance** really needs you. And if you have GTK widgets that you want to
share, please do feel free to propose them.

There is need of help with internationalization too. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **libgnuisance** (`nl`).
First thing to do is to make sure that **GNU Autotools** and **GNU gettext**
are installed on your system. Then clone this repository and launch the
following commands:

``` sh
./bootstrap
make -C po libgnuisance.pot
(cd po && msginit -l nl)
make bootstrap-clean 
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the `po/nl.po` file and translate the strings present. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

For any issue, [drop a message][2].


Installation
------------

On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install this package using the
following common steps:

``` sh
./configure
make
make install-strip
```

If the `strip` utility is not available on your machine, use `make install`
instead (it will produce larger binaries).

If the `configure` script is missing from your package you need to generate it
by running the `bootstrap` script. By default, `bootstrap` will also run the
`configure` script immediately after having generated it, so you may type the
`make` command directly after `bootstrap`. To list different options use
`./bootstrap --help`.

For further information, see [INSTALL][3].
